            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>Reaſons againſt the rendering of Our ſworne and ſubſcribed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Faith.</head>
            <p n="1">1. IF wee ſhould render Our ſubſcribed Covenant, wee can not bee free of the great guiltineſſe of Perjurie before GOD: for as We were drawn by neceſſitie to enter into a mutuall Union and Conjunction amongſt Our ſelves. So are Wee bound not only by the Lawes of GOD and nature, but by Our ſolemne Oath and Subſcription, againſt all dangerous or diviſive motions, by all lawfull meanes to promove and obſerve the ſame without violation, and not ſuffer our ſelves by whatſoever ſuggeſtion, allurement, or terror, directly or indirectly to be divided, or drawn from it: And it is too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that no motion can be more diviſive upon the one ſide, nor can we upon the other part more directly give way to diviſion, then willingly, and with our own conſent to render the band of our union and conjunction to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, that no teſtimony thereof may be any more extant.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We would diſtinguiſh (except wee will deceave our ſelves) between <hi>Res jurata,</hi> that which is ſworn, and <hi>Jurati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> our ſweareing thereof: for although all the generall and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular points contained in our ſubſcribed Covenant were to be inſert in another Covenant, to be made by the expreſſe commandement of authority; yet to rander our ſworne Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, were both to paſſe from our ſwearing thereof, <hi>as ſi res eſſet integra,</hi> as if we had never ſworne and ſubſcribed; and alſo to deſtroy that which we have beene doing, as a thing unlawfull, and to be repented of. It were not only to make our oath to be no oath, our ſubſcription no ſubſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and our teſtimony no teſtimony, but really to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Confeſſe our ſelves in this to have beene tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſours; ſo that we can neither clame any right to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of GOD, nor think our ſelves obliged in any duety to GOD by vertue of that oath. It muſt ever bee remembred that oaths and perjuries are multiplied, not onely according to the diverſity of the things that are ſworne, but according
<pb n="*" facs="tcp:17553:2"/>to the ſweareing of the ſame thing at diverſe times; ſo oft as we ſweare and ſubſcribe the ſame thing, by ſo many oaths and obligations are we bound unto GOD, and conſequently the rendering of our ſubſcription, is the renunceing of that indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duall band and obligation, although poſſibly by another we may ſtand bound or ſworne.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Our voluntary renewing of our Covenant with God, carieth greater evidence of a free ſervice to God, then if it had beene done by expreſſe commandement of authority: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the power of God makeing his people ſo willing, and the readineſſe and ſincerity of the people is ſo much the more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt; like as the LORD from heaven hath teſtified his accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance by the wonderfull workings of his Spirit in the hearts both of paſtors and people, to their great comfort and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in every duety, above any meaſure that ever hath beene heard of in this land; And therefore to give any token of recalling the ſame were unthankfully to miſregard the work of God, and to quite all the comforts and corroborations that the people of God have to their great joy experienced at this time.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We have declared before God and the world, that this our Covenant, as it now ſtandeth ſworne and ſubſcribed, is lawful and neceſſary, that it is done in obedience to the commandement of God, conforme to the practiſe of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and according to the laudable example of our religious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors, who by the like oath have obliged us to the ſubſtance and tenor of this: And therefore if we ſhould now by rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring our Covenant undo that which we have done, we ſhould deny the commandement of God, condemne the examples in ſcripture, and the practiſes in this kirk; and precondemne all like commendable courſes to be taken by poſterity in the like exigence.</p>
            <p n="5">5. No Covenant in things civile can be altered or reſcin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded without conſent of the parties with whom it is made; But Our Covenant is a religious Covenant made with GOD and amongſt Our ſelves, and therefore can not be rendered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the expreſſe conſent of the meaneſt of all the ſubſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; who juſtly for their comfort may crave of Us all the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite and performance thereof.</p>
            <pb n="*" facs="tcp:17553:2"/>
            <p n="6">6. There is no appearance that ſuch as affect the prelats and their courſes, will be moved to ſweare and ſubſcribe all the parts of this Covenant: As for inſtance, To labour by all meanes to recover the former puritie and libertie of the Goſpel, as it was eſtabliſhed and profeſſed, before the novations alreadie introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, or to declare that they undoubtedly to believe, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations and evils contained in Our Supplications, Complaints, and Proteſtations are abjured in the Confeſſion of Faith, as other heads of Poperie expreſſely contained therein.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Although all the points of the ſubſcribed Covenant were ratified by act of Parliament, yet could we not render the ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed Covenants: Becauſe acts of Parliament are changeable, and of the nature of a civile ratification: And it is neceſſarie, that this Our Oath being a religious and perpetuall obligation, ſhould ſtand in vigour for the more firme eſtabliſhing of religion in Our owne time, and in the generations following.</p>
            <p n="8">8. All the world may juſtly wonder at Our inconſtancie, and Our enemies who in their inſolencie are readie to inſult upon Us at the leaſt occaſion, would not ceaſe to mock at Us, and traduce Us as perjured Covenant-breakers, and troublers of the peace of the kirk and kingdome, without any neceſſarie cauſe.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Although We do not compare the Scriptures of God with a written confeſſion of faith, yet as the rendering of the Bible was the ſin of the <hi>Traditores</hi> of old, and a ſigne of the denyall of the truth contained therein: ſo the rendering of Our Confeſſion of faith, ſo ſolemnly ſworn and ſubſcribed, for ſtaying the courſe of defection, and for barring of poperie, and all other corruptions of religion, could be interpreted to be no leſſe, then a reall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyall of Our Faith before men, in a time when GOD calleth for the Confeſſion thereof.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Many fair promiſes have beene made, for not urging of articles already concluded, and for not troubling us with any further novations, which being believed, have enſnared many, and drawne them on to doe that which otherwiſe they would not have done, all which promiſes have beene broken and denyed, when the performance was craved: And why ſhall We not expect the like in this caſe, eſpecially where the chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge will be found to be more hard and difficile.</p>
